# Covid_Response

<b>Motivation:</b> <br>
The COVID-19 outbreak came as a surprise to all of us, shutting down businesses,
the economy and countries all around the world. Many measures like the enforcement of social
distancing and the restriction of international travel were enforced in an effort to contain the
spread of the virus. In order to understand the effectiveness of these measures, one has to study a
tremendous amount of data, drawing parallels and comparisons between different sets of data.
This was the main motivation behind building the COVID-19 Government Response Tracker.
Using this application, we can study how different countries responded to the outbreak of the
virus, what policies they implemented and investments they made in order to contain the spread
of the virus and whether ultimately these measures proved effective against the virus.

<b>The application:</b> <br> 
In order to increase accessibility to users, the COVID-19 Government
Response Tracker is a web based application. It studies the response of the governments of 177
countries over the course of 6 months (starting from 1st January to 27th June 2020). Apart from
studying the number of confirmed cases and deaths in the country, it also looks at various
policies that each country implemented (such as closures of schools and workplace, emergency
investment in healthcare) and the overall stringency of the implementation of policies on every
particular day. By studying these statistics, one can draw important connections between the
enforcement of different policies and how effective they were in the containment of the virus in
that particular country.
